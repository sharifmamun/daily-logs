In Akka/Akka.NET, there is Scheduler to schedule sending repeated message. For more: https://getakka.net/articles/actors/schedulers.html. Here's an example:

If I have something like below:
        Receive<DoSomething>(d =>
        {
            Task.Run(async () => await StartSomething(d, _cts.Token), _cts.Token).PipeTo(Self);

            Become(Working);
        });

Now, if I want to schedule the same thing for a repeated task say for 10 times, using Akka.NET Scheduler, we can easily achieve that like below:

        Receive<DoSomething>(d =>
        {
            for(var i = 0; i < 10; i++)
            {
                Context.System.Scheduler.ScheduleTellOnce(
                    TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1),
                    Self,
                    Task.Run(async () => 
                        await StartSomething(d, _cts.Token), _cts.Token).PipeTo(Self),
                    ActorRefs.Nobody);
            }
            
            Become(Working);
        });
